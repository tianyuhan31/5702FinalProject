**What data sources did you consider? 

**How did you decide which one(s) to analyze?


**Which institutions or individuals maintain the data source(s)?

For this data analysis and visualization project, we have considered several data sources related to public health and community safety. Our incentive was to apply data analysis to generate meaningful insights into public health and safety issues. For instance, we obtained data about the main causes of death from Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death). We’ve also considered the dataset about the NYPD shooting incident from Data.gov(https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-shooting-incident-data-historic). In the end, we decided to use the dataset Crime Data from 2020 to Present provided by LOS ANGELES OPEN DATA (https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8). After carefully analyzing the configuration of the cause of death dataset, we realized that it was a synthesis of several related datasets, such as cause of death by disease types, breakdown of deaths by age, etc. Therefore, the dataset was not provided by the original sources, and the process of selecting and combining different sources might be biased due to personal preferences of the third-party authors. For the NYPD shooting incident dataset, we noticed that the columns of this dataset were limited to sex, race, and geographic locations, which might not help us understand the shooting problems from a comprehensive perspective. While the crime data from 2020 overcame this issue since it provided more statistics about the crime events, including victim ages, type of weapons, type of vehicles, etc. Therefore, we decided to start our study based on the crime dataset, for it not only addressed more possible factors associated with a crime, but also discussed more types of crime activities (not limited to shooting). 

In recent years, the crime and violence rate has risen to a large extent and led to great social concerns. As New York City residents, we have been concerned about public safety issues for a long time, and we would like to apply the quantitative and visualization skills we learned from class to help draw some conclusions on this problem. Potential questions we can answer from the data may include which age of people has the most history of crime, and which are the most common crime types in the city. As one of the largest cities in the States, Los Angeles also suffered from crime and violence in recent years as California’s violent crime rate increased significantly since 2020 (Magnus Lofstrom and Brandon Martin, 2022). In a nutshell, we hope that the analysis of Los Angeles crime data could provide us with a better understanding of crime events, and possibly generate insights into nationwide crime-control strategies. 


**How was the data collected?

The data was provided by the Los Angeles Police Department, and transcribed from original crime reports which are typed on paper.
