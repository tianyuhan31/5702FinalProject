This project performs exploratory data analysis and visualization on a dataset of Los Angeles crime activities. Like many major cities in the world, LA has had an increasing crime and violence rate in recent years. Therefore, the project aims to provide insights from the dataset and answer a wide range of questions, such as the common crime types, victim characteristics, location factors leading to crimes, etc. We would use analytical tools to draw correlations between violent events and related factors and create visualizations for better interpretations. We hope that by studying and understanding the dataset, we can generate and apply meaningful results to other major cities in the world and provide insights of crime reduction strategies.
