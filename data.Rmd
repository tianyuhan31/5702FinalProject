# Data 

## Sources

## Cleaning / transformation
```{r}
projectdata <- read.csv("/Users/tianyuhan/Desktop/5702data.csv")
```

## Missing value analysis
```{r}
colSums(is.na(projectdata)) %>% sort
```

After we import the data into R Studio, we noticed missing values in some of the columns. These missing values are filled with NAs. Then, we used "sapply(data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))" to count the number of NAs in each column. Columns {Crm Cd 2, Crm Cd3, Crm Cd, Cross Street} have a significant number of values missing; therefore we will drop these four columns from our dataset. For other columns that have missing values, we will keep the NAs, but we will not draw conclusions that rely heavily on the values of these columns.
