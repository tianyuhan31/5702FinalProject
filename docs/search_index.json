Within each city, violence is hyper-local, meaning that violence is usually more common in specific neighborhoods or “block-by-block.” Our team wishes to analyze Los Angeles, one of the most iconic cities in the United States, home to movie stars, film studios, amusement parks, and sunny days. Even though Los Angeles is the celebrity mecca of the entire world, violence in certain parts of Los Angeles is an everyday occurrence. Los Angeles and New York City are the two largest cities in the United States, and two of the top 13 most populated metro areas in the world. However, compared to New York City, the city of Los Angeles has a higher murder rate, and it also reports a higher rate of robberies, vandalism, and assaults. For instance, Skid Row is known for its massive homeless community. There’s also South Central and Compton, which are sub-areas plagued by gangs, shootings, and violence. The increasing crime rate has an impact on every one of us, not just Los Angeles residents, and is leading everyone to think how can we prevent these events from happening. Therefore, it raises the question of what type of crime happens the most in Los Angeles, what type of weapons are presented in the scene, and how can we do better to put the police force in certain sub-area, etc. We are hoping that by visualizing and analyzing the crime data in Los Angeles, we can apply the results to other major cities in the United States to help decrease their crime rate, and also generate insights and suggestions for strategies to prevent crimes from happening in the first place. Considering all factors, we chose to analyze the incidents of crime in the city of Los Angeles dating back to 2020 (https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8). 2.2 Data availability For this data analysis and visualization project, we have considered several data sources related to public health and community safety. Our incentive was to apply data analysis to generate meaningful insights into public health and safety issues. Initially, we obtained Cause of Death Dataset from Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death), and have also considered the NYPD Shooting Incident Dataset from Data.gov(https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-shooting-incident-data-historic). After carefully analyzing the configuration of the Cause of Death Dataset, we realized that it was consisted of several related datasets, such as cause of death by disease types, breakdown of deaths by age, etc. This dataset was not provided by the original sources, and the process of selecting and combining different sources might be biased due to personal preferences of the third-party authors. For the NYPD Shooting Incident Dataset, we noticed that the columns of this dataset were limited to sex, race, and geographic locations, which might not help us understand the shooting problems from a comprehensive perspective. In the end, we decided to use the Crime Data from 2020 to Present provided by Los Angeles Open Data.The crime data from 2020 overcame this issue since it provided more statistics about the crime events, including victim ages, type of weapons, type of vehicles, etc. Therefore, we decided to start our study based on the crime dataset, for it not only addressed more possible factors associated with a crime, but also discussed more types of crime activities (not limited to shooting). In recent years, the crime and violence rate has risen to a large extent and led to great social concerns. As New York City residents, we have been concerned about public safety issues for a long time, and we would like to apply the quantitative and visualization skills we learned from class to help draw some conclusions to this problem. Potential questions we can answer from the data may include which age of people has the most history of crime, and which are the most common crime types in the city. As one of the largest cities in the States, Los Angeles also suffered from crime and violence in recent years as California’s violent crime rate increased significantly since 2020 (Magnus Lofstrom and Brandon Martin, 2022). In a nutshell, we hope that the analysis of Los Angeles crime data could provide us with a better understanding of crime events, and possibly generate insights into nationwide crime-control strategies. The crime dataset was provided by the Los Angeles Police Department, and transcribed from original crime reports which are typed on paper. It is available in CSV file, RDF file, JSON file, and XML file. Of these different file formats, we chose CSV because it is the most commonly used format. In order to import the data, we will first import the readr package, which runs around 10 times faster than standard r import. Since our dataset is quite large, containing around 600,000 observations, it would be beneficial to have a faster method to import data. Going into analysis, we might run into questions about the data. We can first go onto the website where the dataset is hosted to find detailed descriptions and notes about the different attributes. If the question still cannot be solved, we can contact the dataset owner, Los Angeles Police Department, via the website to resolve our confusion on the dataset. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources For this project, our group has agreed upon using data analysis to draw useful insights into public health and safety issues that is common to our daily life. After searching for available data on government websites, we have found three candidate options: a Cause of Death Data, a NYPD Shooting Incident Data, and finally LA Crime Data. After looking into the Cause of Death Death Data, we have realized that it was not raw first-hand data collected by the organization; instead, it was a cleaned table combining data from multiple sources. Thus, we have decided not to move forward with it. Next, we looked into NYPD Shooting Data and found that although this data is first-hand and provided in original form, we found that there are only a few columns that we are interested in and can be used to aid our analysis. Thus eventually, we decided to go with LA Crime Data. LA Crime Data contains all the crime recorded in LA metropolitan area from 2020 to Present. It is provided by Los Angeles Police Department and hosted on Los Angeles Open Data. The data is transcribed from original crime reports that are typed on paper and it might cause some inaccuracies within the data. However, given the size of the dataset: more than 600K rows, the minor inaccuracies of the data will not have large impact on our analysis. It is available in CSV file, RDF file, JSON file, and XML file. Of these different file formats, we chose CSV because it is the most commonly used format. The crime data from 2020 provided statistics about multiple aspects about all kinds of crime events in a total of 28 columns. A selection of the important columns and their respective description is listed below: DATE OCC: Date that the crime takes place TIME OCC: Time that the crime takes place Crm Cd Desc: The type of crime commited. Vict Age: Age of the Victim Vict Sex: Sex of the Victim Vict Descent: Descent of the Victim Weapon Desc: Description of the weapon used in crime Status: Status of the crime case Premis Desc: Setting of the crime scene Location: Street address of the crime incident Area: The 21 community police stations in LAPD 3.2 Cleaning / transformation Our data is stored ready to use in a csv file; therefore, we simply just use the read.csv function to import our data set from file and store it in our environment. We do not have to do a lot of cleaning before we start our analysis; however, there are a few columns that we will need to remove beforehand. After taking a detailed look at the columns of the data set. We have found three columns with codes that have their encoded message stored in a different column in the data set. For example, column ‘Crm.Cd’ only contains the code ‘121’. In order to know that the crime committed in this case is ‘rape’, we need to consult column ‘Crm.Cd.Desc’. Therefore, it would be redundant and useless to store both of these columns in our table, given that we can use the readily decoded message in our analysis directly. Thus, we have made the decision to drop these three columns containing codes: {Crm.Cd, Weapon.Used.Cd, Premis.Cd}. We now end up with a table of 25 columns. Note: In the next section, after we performed the missing value analysis, we have decided to drop three more columns, but it will be covered in detail in the later section. 3.3 Missing value analysis ## DR_NO Date.Rptd DATE.OCC TIME.OCC AREA AREA.NAME ## 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## Rpt.Dist.No Part.1.2 Crm.Cd.Desc Mocodes Vict.Age Vict.Sex ## 0 0 0 81768 0 78158 ## Vict.Descent Premis.Desc Weapon.Desc Status Status.Desc Crm.Cd.1 ## 78163 271 381302 0 0 6 ## Crm.Cd.2 Crm.Cd.3 Crm.Cd.4 LOCATION Cross.Street LAT ## 545672 589309 590788 0 491603 0 ## LON ## 0 We used sapply with function to count the number of NAs in each column and graphed the columns using a bar chart. Columns {Crm.Cd.2, Crm.Cd.3, Crm.Cd.4} have a significant number of values missing. The large number of missing values in these three columns are resulting from the fact that the majority of criminals are guilty of a single crime offense. There is very few criminal who commits more than one crime in one offense. Therefore, we decide to drop these three columns for our data analysis project in order to generate analysis on a more general pattern. For other columns that have missing values, we will keep the NAs, but we will not draw conclusions that rely heavily on the NA values of these columns. Similar to what the previous graph has shown us, we are seeing a significant number of row missing from Crm.Cd.4, Crm.Cd.3, and Crm.Cd.2. Also, we are seeing that the columns of victim descent and victim sex are having the same missing pattern. We can safely deter that availabitiy of different information about the victim is highly correlated. If the victim’s sex is not on file, then its descent will not be on file, and vice versa. Therefore, keeping all these columns with missing values and their relative patterns in mind. We will be able to generate more thorough, unbiased findings without any interference caused by missing data.

Since it would be too messy to graph all 20 crimes in one chart. I have combined crimes ranked 10-20 into one categories called ‘others’ and then made another chart. User can access the auxiliary chart by clicking the slice of pie in the main chart called ‘others’. Moreover, user can also come back to the main chart by clicking a button on the auxiliary chart. This interactive pie chart has demonstrated that there’s not a huge gap in frequency among the top 20 most commited crimes in LA. While stolen vehicle is the most committed crime subcategory; theft, taking up 6 subcategories among the top 20, is the most dominant category of crimes committed.
