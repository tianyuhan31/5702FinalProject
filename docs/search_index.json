[["index.html", "5702 Final Project Chapter 1 Introduction", " 5702 Final Project Tianyu Han, Shijia Huang, Lin Gong 2022-12-15 Chapter 1 Introduction We are fortunate enough to be able to live and learn in New York City, one of most modern cities in the world. However, on our way to the classes, we are seeing an increasing number of NYPD officers patrolling through the subway stations, and we are often worried by this trend, which results from an increasing number of crimes in NYC. Therefore, we decided to analyze the trend of crimes in another city similar to New York in many ways, Los Angeles. Los Angeles is similar to New York in many ways. They are both U.S megacities that are at the heart of transportation, tourism, economy, etc, with people from diverse backgrounds all over the world. Los Angeles is the home to movie stars, beaches, film studios and many great things. But on the other hand, it is also the epicentre for some of the infamous gangs in the world such as the Crips and the Bloods. So some potential questions we are interested in and wish to address include what are the most common crime types in Los Angeles, which age group of people has the most history of crime, and what kind of people is most often to be targeted as the victim, etc. From this project, we aim to generate a thorough analysis of crimes in LA, and could potentially relate to these findings ourselves to help us avoid crimes in the future. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic A city with a high violent crime rate does not indicate that the entire city is unsafe. Within each city, violence is hyper-local, meaning that violence is usually more common in specific neighborhoods or “block-by-block.” Our team wishes to analyze Los Angeles, one of the most iconic cities in the United States, home to movie stars, film studios, amusement parks, and sunny days. Even though Los Angeles is the celebrity mecca of the entire world, violence in certain parts of Los Angeles is an everyday occurrence. Los Angeles and New York City are the two largest cities in the United States, and two of the top 13 most populated metro areas in the world. However, compared to New York City, the city of Los Angeles has a higher murder rate, and it also reports a higher rate of robberies, vandalism, and assaults. For instance, Skid Row is known for its massive homeless community. There’s also South Central and Compton, which are sub-areas plagued by gangs, shootings, and violence. The increasing crime rate has an impact on every one of us, not just Los Angeles residents, and is leading everyone to think how can we prevent these events from happening. Therefore, it raises the question of what type of crime happens the most in Los Angeles, what type of weapons are presented in the scene, and how can we do better to put the police force in certain sub-area, etc. We are hoping that by visualizing and analyzing the crime data in Los Angeles, we can apply the results to other major cities in the United States to help decrease their crime rate, and also generate insights and suggestions for strategies to prevent crimes from happening in the first place. Considering all factors, we chose to analyze the incidents of crime in the city of Los Angeles dating back to 2020 (https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8). 2.2 Data availability For this data analysis and visualization project, we have considered several data sources related to public health and community safety. Our incentive was to apply data analysis to generate meaningful insights into public health and safety issues. Initially, we obtained Cause of Death Dataset from Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death), and have also considered the NYPD Shooting Incident Dataset from Data.gov(https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-shooting-incident-data-historic). After carefully analyzing the configuration of the Cause of Death Dataset, we realized that it was consisted of several related datasets, such as cause of death by disease types, breakdown of deaths by age, etc. This dataset was not provided by the original sources, and the process of selecting and combining different sources might be biased due to personal preferences of the third-party authors. For the NYPD Shooting Incident Dataset, we noticed that the columns of this dataset were limited to sex, race, and geographic locations, which might not help us understand the shooting problems from a comprehensive perspective. In the end, we decided to use the Crime Data from 2020 to Present provided by Los Angeles Open Data.The crime data from 2020 overcame this issue since it provided more statistics about the crime events, including victim ages, type of weapons, type of vehicles, etc. Therefore, we decided to start our study based on the crime dataset, for it not only addressed more possible factors associated with a crime, but also discussed more types of crime activities (not limited to shooting). In recent years, the crime and violence rate has risen to a large extent and led to great social concerns. As New York City residents, we have been concerned about public safety issues for a long time, and we would like to apply the quantitative and visualization skills we learned from class to help draw some conclusions to this problem. Potential questions we can answer from the data may include which age of people has the most history of crime, and which are the most common crime types in the city. As one of the largest cities in the States, Los Angeles also suffered from crime and violence in recent years as California’s violent crime rate increased significantly since 2020 (Magnus Lofstrom and Brandon Martin, 2022). In a nutshell, we hope that the analysis of Los Angeles crime data could provide us with a better understanding of crime events, and possibly generate insights into nationwide crime-control strategies. The crime dataset was provided by the Los Angeles Police Department, and transcribed from original crime reports which are typed on paper. It is available in CSV file, RDF file, JSON file, and XML file. Of these different file formats, we chose CSV because it is the most commonly used format. In order to import the data, we will first import the readr package, which runs around 10 times faster than standard r import. Since our dataset is quite large, containing around 600,000 observations, it would be beneficial to have a faster method to import data. Going into analysis, we might run into questions about the data. We can first go onto the website where the dataset is hosted to find detailed descriptions and notes about the different attributes. If the question still cannot be solved, we can contact the dataset owner, Los Angeles Police Department, via the website to resolve our confusion on the dataset. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources For this project, our group has agreed upon using data analysis to draw useful insights into public health and safety issues that is common to our daily life. After searching for available data on government websites, we have found three candidate options: a Cause of Death Data, a NYPD Shooting Incident Data, and finally LA Crime Data. After looking into the Cause of Death Death Data, we have realized that it was not raw first-hand data collected by the organization; instead, it was a cleaned table combining data from multiple sources. Thus, we have decided not to move forward with it. Next, we looked into NYPD Shooting Data and found that although this data is first-hand and provided in original form, we found that there are only a few columns that we are interested in and can be used to aid our analysis. Thus eventually, we decided to go with LA Crime Data. LA Crime Data contains all the crime recorded in LA metropolitan area from 2020 to Present. It is provided by Los Angeles Police Department and hosted on Los Angeles Open Data. The data is transcribed from original crime reports that are typed on paper and it might cause some inaccuracies within the data. However, given the size of the dataset: more than 600K rows, the minor inaccuracies of the data will not have large impact on our analysis. It is available in CSV file, RDF file, JSON file, and XML file. Of these different file formats, we chose CSV because it is the most commonly used format. The crime data from 2020 provided statistics about multiple aspects about all kinds of crime events in a total of 28 columns. A selection of the important columns and their respective description is listed below: DATE OCC: Date that the crime takes place TIME OCC: Time that the crime takes place Crm Cd Desc: The type of crime commited. Vict Age: Age of the Victim Vict Sex: Sex of the Victim Vict Descent: Descent of the Victim Weapon Desc: Description of the weapon used in crime Status: Status of the crime case Premis Desc: Setting of the crime scene Location: Street address of the crime incident Area: The 21 community police stations in LAPD 3.2 Cleaning / transformation Our data is stored ready to use in a csv file; therefore, we simply just use the read.csv function to import our data set from file and store it in our environment. We do not have to do a lot of cleaning before we start our analysis; however, there are a few columns that we will need to remove beforehand. After taking a detailed look at the columns of the data set. We have found three columns with codes that have their encoded message stored in a different column in the data set. For example, column ‘Crm.Cd’ only contains the code ‘121’. In order to know that the crime committed in this case is ‘rape’, we need to consult column ‘Crm.Cd.Desc’. Therefore, it would be redundant and useless to store both of these columns in our table, given that we can use the readily decoded message in our analysis directly. Thus, we have made the decision to drop these three columns containing codes: {Crm.Cd, Weapon.Used.Cd, Premis.Cd}. We now end up with a table of 25 columns. Note: In the next section, after we performed the missing value analysis, we have decided to drop three more columns, but it will be covered in detail in the later section. 3.3 Missing value analysis ## DR_NO Date.Rptd DATE.OCC TIME.OCC AREA AREA.NAME ## 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## Rpt.Dist.No Part.1.2 Crm.Cd.Desc Mocodes Vict.Age Vict.Sex ## 0 0 0 81768 0 78158 ## Vict.Descent Premis.Desc Weapon.Desc Status Status.Desc Crm.Cd.1 ## 78163 271 381302 0 0 6 ## Crm.Cd.2 Crm.Cd.3 Crm.Cd.4 LOCATION Cross.Street LAT ## 545672 589309 590788 0 491603 0 ## LON ## 0 We used sapply with function to count the number of NAs in each column and graphed the columns using a bar chart. Columns {Crm.Cd.2, Crm.Cd.3, Crm.Cd.4} have a significant number of values missing. The large number of missing values in these three columns are resulting from the fact that the majority of criminals are guilty of a single crime offense. There is very few criminal who commits more than one crime in one offense. Therefore, we decide to drop these three columns for our data analysis project in order to generate analysis on a more general pattern. For other columns that have missing values, we will keep the NAs, but we will not draw conclusions that rely heavily on the NA values of these columns. Similar to what the previous graph has shown us, we are seeing a significant number of row missing from Crm.Cd.4, Crm.Cd.3, and Crm.Cd.2. Also, we are seeing that the columns of victim descent and victim sex are having the same missing pattern. We can safely deter that availabitiy of different information about the victim is highly correlated. If the victim’s sex is not on file, then its descent will not be on file, and vice versa. Therefore, keeping all these columns with missing values and their relative patterns in mind. We will be able to generate more thorough, unbiased findings without any interference caused by missing data.

As we can see, Central has the highest number of crime activity, followed by 77th Street, Pacific, and Southwest district. Therefore people living in these areas in Los Angeles should pay more attention to their well-being. 4.2 Bar chart for race of the victim We want to create this bar chart showing the count for each crime victim’s race. As we can see from the bar chart, H has the highest number of count, which corresponds to Hispanic/ Latin/ Mexican. The second highest count is W, which is White, and the third highest one is B, Black. 4.3 Cleveland dot pot for the most often crime location From the cleveland dot plot, we can tell that the most likely place that crime will take place is on the street, where a lot more crime activities in Los Angeles had taken place. The rank is followed by single family dwelling, and multi-unit dwelling such as apartment and duplex. And we can not ignore the fact that places like parking lot, sidewalk, etc. also have a high count of crime activities, there these are also places that people need to be careful around. 4.4 Bar chart for the top20 most likely commited crime We are curious about which crime are more likely to take place so we create this graph to show the top 20 most often commited crime. From the graph, we can clearly see that stolen vehicles are among the highest possible crime that took place in Los Angeles. People in California tend to drive more often, so this increases the possibility of criminals commiting this crime. Other than stolen vehicles, the most often commited crime is followed by simple assault, burglary from vehicle, and vandalism. 4.5 Most likely age range to be a crime victim As the graph shows, after filtering out Vict.Age is 0 (which is impossible to be a victim’s age), we can tell from the graph that there is a huge increase in the total number of crime happening to a victim at the age of 20. The number keeps growing up as age increases, and there is huge spike at age around 25 to 30. We think that the reason why this happens is because people within this age range tend to go out more often. Especially during the night, where crime is more likely to happen. Thus as the graph shows, people between 20 to 55 are more likely to become victim of crime activities. 4.6 Separate age range and observe each group Now we separated Vict.Age into three intervals, 1-20, 21-40, and 41-100 because based on the previous plot, the graph seemed to increase a lot in count at age 20. Therefore we want to take a closer look at each age group, we can see that there is a lot less crime taken place on people younger than 20 years old, but within the age group, simple assault is the most common crime. Whereas among teenager and young adults between 21-40 years old, burglary from vehicle is most likely to happen on the victim. The reason might be teenagers and young adults tend to go out in cars more often than children and the elderly. Thus increasing the possibility of being attacked or getting robbed from a vehicle. And for middle age and elderly, simple assault is again the most likely crime to take place. Notice that burglary is ranked top 3 for this age group. The elderly are more likely to be considered as vulnerable, and therefore more likely to face burglary. 4.7 The most likely happened crime for each gender group We created this graph because we want to see if different gender group is more likely to face different kinds of crime. As we can see, for the female gender group, they are more likely to face assault from intimate partner followed by simple assault and theft of identity. This in deed leads us to another serious problem about the safety of women at home. But for the male gender group, the most likely crime that will happen is assault with deadly weapon followed by simple assault and burglary from vehicle. Men are tend to be a little more aggressive, and therefore might be involved in an argue more often. Thus an aggravated assult is more likely to happen on men. 4.8 Theft over time In this graph, we specifically focused on the crime ‘Vehicle-stolen’, which ranked the highest among the most likely crime to happen in Los Angeles. Here from the graph we can see that the number of vehicles stolen has increased since 2020 in general. During which was the time when COVID-19 started to spread. Everyone was experiencing a hard time, and therefore crime activities (stolen vehicles) also increased. There was a time between end of 2020 to beginning of 2021 that it did not increase dramatically (almost the same), and there is a little decrease from mid 2022, but still the number of crime has been increasing in general since 2020 till now. 4.9 Top 10 Weapons By creating this pie chart we can easily visualize the top 10 weapons used in crime activities in Los Angeles. After eliminating the N/A recorded weapon, we can tell that the most often used weapons in crimes is “Strong-Arm” which includes hands, fist and other bodily forces. So people tend to involve in an argument or an assault where bodily forces are involved. Other than unknown weapon, the rank for weapon used is followed by verbal threat, and hand gun. 4.10 Heatmap for visualizing the frequency of crimes in each area by month First we define a function to extract the month value of crimes from their DATE.OCC. Then use this function to create a new dataframe df_month containing the information of crime month, area of crime, and frequency. Then, create a heatmap based on the df_month to display the severity of crime rate in different area each month. From this heatmap we can see that first, most crime activities are focused in Central and 77th Street district. Some falls in Pacific, and a few in Southwest. Among the two most concentrated district, most crime activities happens in July, August, and October. Also, we can see that there are barely any crimes happening in December for any of the districts.

Since it would be too messy to graph all 20 crimes in one chart. I have combined crimes ranked 10-20 into one categories called ‘others’ and then made another chart. User can access the auxiliary chart by clicking the slice of pie in the main chart called ‘others’. Moreover, user can also come back to the main chart by clicking a button on the auxiliary chart. This interactive pie chart has demonstrated that there’s not a huge gap in frequency among the top 20 most commited crimes in LA. While stolen vehicle is the most committed crime subcategory; theft, taking up 6 subcategories among the top 20, is the most dominant category of crimes committed. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion 6.1 Main takeaway 6.2 Limitation 6.3 Future directions 6.4 Lesson learned", " Chapter 6 Conclusion 6.1 Main takeaway In this project, our team chose to analyze one of the most iconic cities, Los Angeles, in the United States, known to be home to movie stars, and film studios, but also violence in certain areas. We used different graph visualization tools to display the relationship between different variables. As displayed in the results session, we used a bar chart to show the frequency of crimes associated with victim races and concluded that Hispanic/ Latin/ Mexican are the races that are most likely to be crime victims. The second highest is White, and the third is Black. We are also interested in finding out which specific areas these crimes took place, for instance, do people get attacked in the parking lot more often than in the alley? The Cleveland dot pot helped us compare the frequencies of crimes in different places and visualize them regarding each other’s relative frequency. Based on our observation, crimes mostly happen on streets or in single-family dwellings, and the places where crimes were most likely to happen were Central, followed by 77th Street, specifically. The bar chart also enabled us to view the top 20 most likely committed crimes in LA. Meanwhile, bar charts with facets allowed us to split the crimes based on different groups, and we can thus discuss crime types with regard to the victim’s ages. Similarly, splitting crimes into gender groups also provided insights into which crime types were associated with each gender more frequently. For some specific crimes such as theft, we used geom_smooth to visualize the yearly count for stolen items (vehicles in our case), and the smooth line indicated a slightly increasing trend starting from 2020 on. The pie chart on the most used weapons displayed the percentage of weapons involved in crimes. Dropping the N/As, the most used weapon was “Strong-Arm” such as hands and fists, followed by verbal threats and handguns. Last but not least, we created a heatmap to display the number of crimes in LA by month of crimes and area. The shade of the heatmap helped users to clearly understand the severity of the crime rate concerning area names and monthly trends. Again, Central and 77th Street had the most crime happenings, and crimes were approximately evenly split between different months, except that fewer crimes happened in December. 6.2 Limitation Although data visualization tools enabled us to generate graphs regarding the topics or the relationships we are interested in, we could not understand the fundamental reasons for such observations. For example, the graph of crime frequencies vs. victim ages could tell whether an age group was likely to become crime victims. But we may still have to combine the graph with other information, such as crime place and time, or even a questionnaire and other research results, to generate more meaningful insights on why the crime happened and how we could help lower the crime rate. 6.3 Future directions We can expand our timeline to years before the pandemic, for instance, collect data from 2012 till the present. Then we will be able to conclude if the pandemic has affected and changed a lot of people’s living environment, thus contributing to the increasing crime rate in Los Angeles, and similarly for other big cities in the United States. Also, if we focus on two or three specific areas where the crime rate is extremely high in Los Angeles, we will be able to dig deeper into those districts and provide a more detailed analysis as to why these specific areas are more likely to have crime activities. And thus making proper predictions about the crime rate and types for 2023. 6.4 Lesson learned By completing the project, our team became more familiar with the characteristics of data visualization tools and learned to choose different graphs when analyzing results and relationships. For example, using a pie chart to plot the most frequently used weapons was probably the most appropriate compared to other chart types. Similarly, creating bar chart with facets could help us visualize the frequency of crime types and at the same time compare and discuss victims’ ages in these crimes. To sum up, the project taught us to analyze data types and characteristics to understand our data structure and consider the information we could generate based on the variable. We also gained plentiful hands-on experience in plotting graphs and playing with graph characteristics. Therefore, with the tools and skills learned, we created multiple graphs with commentary explanations of the analysis of crime in LA, and wish that our results can contribute to some ongoing or future studies of crime rate control.
