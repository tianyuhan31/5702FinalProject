So is Los Angeles, San Francisco, and many more. These big cities in the United States are at the heart of transportation, tourism, etc., with people from diverse backgrounds from all over the world. Despite having a population of more than 8 million people, NYC consistently ranks in the top 10 safest large cities (defined as those with more than 500,000 residents) in the United States. It’s generally considered safe for travelers, which is why the city sees more than 65 million visitors per year. However, crime happens, as within any major city in the world. For instance, if we pay attention to the news, the MTA has recently had many heartbreaking accidents including people being pushed down the railway or getting hit by an oncoming train. And there are other crimes such as burglary and arson happening in sub-areas in the city. All of which has huge impacts on our daily life as students studying and living in this city. On the other hand, though New York City used to be known for having a large amount of crime, the actual statistics paint a different story. Crime in the city has been on a downward trend since the 90s, and New York City is now considered one of the safest cities of its size. So our team considered another major city Los Angeles, home to movie stars, beaches, film studios, etc. But on the other hand, this city is also the home of some of most the infamous gangs in the world including the Crips and the Bloods. So some potential questions we wish to address include what are the most common crime types in Los Angeles, which age range of people has the most history of crime, and what kind of people is most often to be targeted as the victim, etc. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic A city with a high violent crime rate does not indicate that the entire city is unsafe. Within each city, violence is hyper-local, meaning that violence is usually more common in specific neighborhoods or “block-by-block.” ## Data availability For this data analysis and visualization project, we have considered several data sources related to public health and community safety. Our incentive was to apply data analysis to generate meaningful insights into public health and safety issues. For instance, we obtained data about the main causes of death from Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death). We’ve also considered the dataset about the NYPD shooting incident from Data.gov(https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-shooting-incident-data-historic). In the end, we decided to use the dataset Crime Data from 2020 to Present provided by LOS ANGELES OPEN DATA (https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8). After carefully analyzing the configuration of the cause of death dataset, we realized that it was a synthesis of several related datasets, such as cause of death by disease types, breakdown of deaths by age, etc. Therefore, the dataset was not provided by the original sources, and the process of selecting and combining different sources might be biased due to personal preferences of the third-party authors. For the NYPD shooting incident dataset, we noticed that the columns of this dataset were limited to sex, race, and geographic locations, which might not help us understand the shooting problems from a comprehensive perspective. While the crime data from 2020 overcame this issue since it provided more statistics about the crime events, including victim ages, type of weapons, type of vehicles, etc. Therefore, we decided to start our study based on the crime dataset, for it not only addressed more possible factors associated with a crime, but also discussed more types of crime activities (not limited to shooting). In recent years, the crime and violence rate has risen to a large extent and led to great social concerns. As New York City residents, we have been concerned about public safety issues for a long time, and we would like to apply the quantitative and visualization skills we learned from class to help draw some conclusions on this problem. Potential questions we can answer from the data may include which age of people has the most history of crime, and which are the most common crime types in the city. As one of the largest cities in the States, Los Angeles also suffered from crime and violence in recent years as California’s violent crime rate increased significantly since 2020 (Magnus Lofstrom and Brandon Martin, 2022). In a nutshell, we hope that the analysis of Los Angeles crime data could provide us with a better understanding of crime events, and possibly generate insights into nationwide crime-control strategies. The data was provided by the Los Angeles Police Department, and transcribed from original crime reports which are typed on paper. It is available in CSV file, RDF file, JSON file, and XML file. Of these different file formats, we chose CSV because it is the most commonly used format. In order to import the data, we will first import the readr package, which runs around 10 times faster than standard r import. Since our dataset is quite large, containing around 600,000 observations, it would be beneficial to have a faster method to import data. Going into analysis, we might run into questions about the data. We can first go onto the website where the dataset is hosted to find detailed descriptions and notes about the different attributes. If the question still cannot be solved, we can contact the dataset owner, Los Angeles Police Department, via the website to resolve our confusion on the dataset. 2.1.1 Missing Values in Dataset After we import the data into R Studio, we noticed missing values in some of the columns. These missing values are filled with NAs. Then, we used “sapply(data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))” to count the number of NAs in each column. Columns {Crm Cd 2, Crm Cd3, Crm Cd, Cross Street} have a significant number of values missing; therefore we will drop these four columns from our dataset. For other columns that have missing values, we will keep the NAs, but we will not draw conclusions that rely heavily on the values of these columns.
